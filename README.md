# GeneralHealthBots.ahk
Small script for setting independent reminders to drink and switch from a sitting to a standing working position and back. Originally only intended to be a locally run analogue of the [Stay_Hydrated_Bot](https://www.twitch.tv/stay_hydrated_bot/about) on twitch. 
However, as I am myself suffering from a bad posture as a result of way too much time hunched over in front of a pc, this script will double as a reminder to regularly stand up and sit down again as well. Both bots can be used completely independent of each other.
