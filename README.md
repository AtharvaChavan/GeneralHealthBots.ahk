# GeneralHealthBots.ahk
Small script for setting independent reminders to drink and switch from a sitting to a standing working position and back. Originally only intended to be a locally run analogue of the [Stay_Hydrated_Bot](https://www.twitch.tv/stay_hydrated_bot/about) on twitch. 
However, as I am myself suffering from a bad posture as a result of way too much time hunched over in front of a pc, this script will double as a reminder to regularly stand up and sit down again as well. Both bots can be used completely independent of each other.

## Set Timer

## Pause
Deactivate the notification and sound played whenever the timer goes off. Note that the timer itself continues running, however it will not execute any code when it triggers.




## HUD & Sound
Toggle wether or not a HUD or Sound is used to notify the user when the timer goes off.
Note that pausing the bot has the same effect as unchecking both "HUD" and "Sound" for the respective bot. 
Functionally this also just prohibits the respective aspect from triggering, the timer itself doesn't stop.
